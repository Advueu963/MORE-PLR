# MORE-PLR
This repository contains the source code for the paper **"MOREâ€“PLR: Multi-Output Regression
Employed for Partial Label Ranking"**.
The data shown in the paper can be found in the **data/** folder. \
If you are interested of applying these models yourself, take a look at the *SimpleStart.py* file.
But generally the models were implemented in the typical *sklearn* style, with fit and predict.

# Reproducibility
Firstly make sure to have scikit-lr installed (the current state-of-the-art).
To install execute the following command in the *scikit-lr* folder: `pip install --verbose --no-build-isolation --editable .; python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
General python requirements can be installed via *enviroment.yml*. \
At the end one might need to execute `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` in the root folder, to build the Cython *_overlap_intervals.pyx* file. \
The scripts used for the experiments can be found in *MORE/experiments* \

# Results
All results can be found in `data/MultiRegression`.
The 3 main files `LR_and_PLR.csv`,`LR_and_PLR_Missing.csv`and `LR_and_PLR_sensitivity_analysis.csv`contain all the mentioned results in the paper.
The `Everythin.csv` has merged all the 3 above-mentioned files.
All other files contained in that directory/subdirectories are individual evaluations for each discussed model.
